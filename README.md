# HTML5 Video Keyframes

JavaScript library for keyframes in HTML5 video with XML

## Usage

I intend to document this but right now there is a decent example in the examples folder. 

It's called basic but it does everything it needs to show right now

## Dependencies

[xml2json](https://github.com/ron-liu/xml2json) - XML to JSON Parser. THis one was chosen causeit was on bower making it easier to install
[es6-promise](https://github.com/components/es6-promise) - This is a polyfill of the ES6 Promise. Not strictly necessary but if you want it to work on Safari you'll need this

## TODO:

* Write documentation
* Find alternative for eval (cause everyone gets their knickers in a twist when eval is used)
